## Case Overview  

The test consisted of three main parts:  

### 1. Spreadsheet Analysis  
- Completed missing data (purchase & selling prices).  
- Calculated profit/loss per transaction.  
- Identified net deficit of –190K (despite 248K gains).  

### 2. Top 10 Products & Stock Review  
- Ranked products by profitability.  
- Highlighted high-demand items needing restock (Banana, Bilberry, Currant).  
- Flagged slow-moving, loss-making items (Physalis, Pomelo, Pomegranate).  
- Suggested bundling and pricing adjustments.  

### 3. Business Case Insights  

**Chat Performance**  
- Facebook Leads ≈ New Chats → focus on one KPI.  
- December peak → build holiday playbook.  
- Q4 consistently above average → invest marketing & stock ahead.  

**Sales & Channels**  
- WhatsApp = 93% of orders → prioritize digital channel.  
- July–August peaks → seasonal campaign strategy.  
- Sep–Oct lows → urgency offers + loyalty programs.  

**Payments**  
- Bank Transfer dominant but slow → introduce QRIS, push Multifinance.  
- BNI CC: lowest adoption & longest delay → promote with incentives or deprioritize.
